        A viewer is whoever clicks a Linky. When they&apos;re signed into
        their Linky account, the rules engine can match on who they are.
        When they&apos;re not, only anonymous rules apply.

        <p className="terminal-label">Signed-in vs anonymous</p>
        <p>
          Viewers sign in with their Linky account — the same account they
          created to manage their own launch bundles. Anonymous viewers open
          the launcher without signing in; they see the public URL list and
          only match rules that use <code>anonymous</code> or{" "}
          <code>always</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a policy is attached to a Linky but the viewer is signed out,
          the launcher shows a &quot;sign in to personalize&quot; nudge
          alongside the public tabs. The link still works without an
          account; signing in just unlocks anything the rules had planned
          for them.

        <p className="terminal-label">Missing fields quietly fail to match</p>
        <p>
          A viewer without a connected GitHub account simply doesn&apos;t
          match a rule that references <code>githubLogin</code>. A viewer
          with no organization memberships won&apos;t match any{" "}
          <code>orgSlugs</code> rule. There&apos;s no error — evaluation
          keeps walking the rule list, and falls through to the public tabs
          if nothing matches. Write rules assuming some fields will be
          absent for some viewers.

          This page is about the viewer opening your Linky. The separate
          layer — who inside your team can edit, delete, and manage the
          launch bundle — is covered by{" "}
          <Link href="/docs/access-control">Access control</Link>. Same
          Clerk identity feeds both, but the rules are independent: a
          viewer rule never affects what a teammate can do in the
          dashboard.
